It seems to me that the markets have become so incredibly important to him, far more than in his previous term.\nBut it may be more sinister than that, because the market is what\u2019s keeping the economy from going into a recession. If the stock market collapses, that\u2019s basically your initial trigger for the recession (and then you have the generational buying opportunity).\n\nAnyway, the moment the premarket opened, I slid in a tiny $UVIX -&gt; $SVIX exchange to continue my DCA on SVIX.  And some small nibbles on ETHU BITU.\n\nOptions expiration today\u2026 Though I think most of the real activity happened yesterday, so today should be a lot calmer.\n\nBut I would have sold at least half of my UVIX position between $16-$17 if I was given the opportunity which of course was frustrating that it all happened out of reach.\n\nI don\u2019t believe that that was the end of this selling, not at $SPY658, that\u2019s for sure.  But will have to wait till next week.",

Upcoming earnings on Tuesday, 10/21/2025 for $GM \nBearish (3.2) \nGeneral Motors (GM) Financial Analysis \nGeneral Motors currently faces significant challenges, as evidenced by a recent $1.X.6 billion impairment charge related to its electric vehicle (EV) strategy overhaul. \nThe charge includes $1.X.2 billion in non-cash impairments and $400 million in cash costs, reflecting the company&#39;s need to adjust to changing market conditions, such as the expiration of federal EV tax credits. \nDespite these setbacks, GM has seen a 20.7% stock increase over the past year and a 72.2% return over three years, suggesting resilience among investors. \nHowever, the company&#39;s recent dip of 2.3% over the last month signals ongoing volatility in the auto sector, especially concerning EV sales. \nOn the financial metrics front, GM&#39;s P/E ratio stands at a level that reflects cautious optimism but is not overly high compared to industry peers, indicating a balanced view of future growth. \nHowever, the company&#39;s EPS growth has been under pressure due to strategic realignments. \nRevenue forecasts for the upcoming quarters appear mixed, with analysts debating the impact of policy changes on GM&#39;s bottom line. \nComparatively, industry peers such as Ford and Stellantis have also faced challenges, although their responses to tariffs and tax credit changes have varied. \n \nUpcoming Earnings Report Overview \nGeneral Motors is set to release its Q3 earnings shortly, and the expectations are mixed. \nAnalysts anticipate a potential earnings beat, driven by strong EV sales prior to the expiration of the federal tax credit. \nHowever, there&#39;s also concern over a projected double-digit drop in earnings due to strategic shifts and the $1.X.6 billion charge. \nHistorically, GM has a track record of outperforming earnings estimates, which could play favorably in the upcoming report. \nThe potential impact of these earnings on GM&#39;s stock will depend on how well the company communicates its strategic pivots and long-term vision to investors. \n \nSector Performance \nThe automotive sector, to which GM belongs, is currently experiencing a turbulent period. \nThe sector has been affected by policy changes, including tariff impositions and tax credit expirations, which have created a challenging environment for U.S. \nautomakers. \nWhile there have been bright spots, such as record EV sales and strategic partnerships in emerging markets, the overall sentiment remains cautious. \nConsumer interest in EVs is high, but economic uncertainties and policy shifts continue to cloud the outlook. \nAs such, the sector&#39;s performance is expected to remain volatile in the near term, with a focus on how automakers navigate these macroeconomic challenges. \n \n- Funds were net buyers of $GM during the previous reporting quarter. \n \n- Funds with large holdings in $GM include: \n \n- Viking Global Investors LP, MV: $641MM.

Upcoming earnings on Tuesday, 10/21/2025 for $DHR \nBearish (3.0) \nFinancial Analysis: \nDanaher Corporation (NYSE:DHR) currently faces a mixed outlook, as reflected in its recent stock performance and analyst sentiments. \nThe company&#39;s shares have experienced a decline of 10.7% year-to-date and are down 24.0% over the past year. \nThis underperformance is juxtaposed with a modest 5.6% increase over the last five years, indicating potential stagnation for long-term investors. \nThe company&#39;s trailing P/E ratio stands at 39.47, with a forward P/E of 21.69, suggesting a premium valuation in comparison to its industry peers. \nAnalysts have recently downgraded the stock from a &quot;&quot;Buy&quot;&quot; to a &quot;&quot;Hold,&quot;&quot; with a reduced price target of $220 from $245, highlighting concerns over its elevated valuation. \nDespite the concerns, Danaher continues to demonstrate strength in certain sectors, such as bioprocessing and diagnostics. \nThe company has recently launched several innovative projects, including AI-powered digital pathology solutions and advancements in gene editing tools, which may bolster its growth prospects. \nHowever, headwinds persist, particularly in its life sciences segment due to weak demand, and challenges in the Chinese market. \nIn comparison to industry peers like Thermo Fisher Scientific and Agilent Technologies, Danaher remains competitive in innovation and strategic acquisitions. \nHowever, its high debt levels and recent legal investigations may pose risks to its financial stability and reputation. \n \nUpcoming Earnings Report: \nDanaher is set to announce its third-quarter results on October 21, 2025. \nAnalysts expect earnings growth to be mostly flat, a continuation of its fiscal second quarter performance, where it reported a revenue of $5.94 billion, surpassing Wall Street estimates. \nThe upcoming earnings call will be closely watched for insights into its financial performance and future expectations. \nHistorical performance indicates the company has managed to meet or exceed earnings expectations, but the current analyst consensus suggests a cautious outlook. \nAnalyst expectations are focused on the healthcare tools and life sciences business, where operational strength is anticipated. \nHowever, any deviation from these expectations could significantly impact the stock&#39;s performance. \n \nSector Performance: \nThe healthcare sector, to which Danaher belongs, has been underperforming relative to broader indices like the S&amp;P 500. \nOver the past six months, healthcare stocks have seen a collective gain of 1.4%, trailing behind the S&amp;P 500&#39;s 15.5% rise. \nThe sector faces ongoing challenges, including COVID-related inventory destocking and broader macroeconomic pressures. \nNonetheless, it remains a critical area for innovation, with long-term prospects driven by advancements in drug development and digital health solutions. \nDespite short-term headwinds, the sector&#39;s commitment to innovation positions it for potential recovery and growth in the future. \n \n- Funds were net buyers of $DHR during the previous reporting quarter. \n \n- Funds with large holdings in $DHR include: \n \n- Aristotle Capital Management LLC, MV: $814MM.
