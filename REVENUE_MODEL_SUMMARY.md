## Conclusion

**The Opportunity:** StockTwits' high-value asset is the 29.4% high-twitch user base that drives 71.6% of revenue potential. By building premium features for day traders, options traders, and scalpers—focused on speed, execution, and time-sensitivity—you can achieve $50M+ annual revenue without needing massive user growth.

**The Strategy:** Double down on high-twitch users, build one-tap trade execution, leverage time-sensitivity with agentic trades and prediction markets, and create a reputation economy with leaderboards and badges.

**The Risk:** Over-indexing on low-twitch users (29.8% of MAU, 3.6% of revenue) or building features for the masses instead of the high-value minority.

**Next Steps:**
1. Launch copy trades (basic MVP)
2. Embed one-tap execution in feed
3. Integrate Kalshi for prediction markets
4. Build PNL leaderboards
5. Measure ARPU lift by segment
