In 2024, Treasury dramatically increased short-term issuance, especially Treasury Bills (T-Bills).

They have tremendous support from hyperscalers and NVDA. Barring external geopolitical / economic factors, CRWV will fix the situation by increasing revenues and postponing debt repayment. CORZ has none of these characteristics, its weakest spot is that it is still a hybrid bitcoin mining / hosting company, and it too has a heavy debt that is several times larger than revenues. (and revenues decreased in 2025!) I am not an analyst! It is just my opinion. I do not own any security of any bitcoin miners, I don&#39;t see the point in that. And I don&#39;t work at CRWV lol, I wish haha. Have a great weekend! :-)  PS: I don&#39;t own any stock of CRWV, options only, hence not only I don&#39;t work there but I don&#39;t vote either see?
